## v1.2.0-alpha ✨ (01-03-2025)

### ➕ Added

- **Enhanced Inline Documentation and JSDoc Comments**
  - Added detailed JSDoc annotations for private members (e.g., in `Signal` and `Emitter` classes) to clarify internal behavior.
  - Updated the `ComponentDefinition` typedef with more descriptive explanations for each property.
  - Improved inline comments in the `Eleva` core class, providing detailed documentation for properties, parameters, and internal methods.

### 🎛️ Changed

- **Context Object Update in Mounting Process**
  - The component mounting context now includes the entire `emitter` instance instead of exposing separate `emit` and `on` functions. This change simplifies event handling in component setup.
- **Minor Code Refactoring & Documentation Enhancements**
  - Formatting and comment improvements across the codebase for better readability and maintainability.

> **Note:** These changes are internal improvements and documentation enhancements.

## v1.1.0-alpha (27-02-2025)

### ➕ Added

- **Local Child Components Registration**
  - Allow child components to be defined locally within a parent’s `children` map rather than requiring global registration via `app.component("name", { ... })`.
  - Updated the `_mountChildren` method to directly mount child components using local definitions.
- **Optional Setup Method Support**
  - Enhanced the `mount` method to allow components to be registered without a `setup()` method by defaulting to an empty object if none is provided.
- **Flexible Mounting API**
  - Modified the `mount` method to accept either a global component name (a string) or a direct component definition (an object), thereby improving component registration flexibility.
  - Added robust error handling for invalid component parameters.
- **Enhanced Documentation & Typing**
  - Added comprehensive JSDoc annotations and updated inline documentation for all classes and methods.
  - Introduced a new `@typedef` for `ComponentDefinition` to improve type safety and developer guidance.

### 🎛️ Changed

- **TemplateEngine**
  - Modified the `evaluate` method to use `Object.values(data)` instead of mapping over keys, streamlining the extraction of data values for expression evaluation.
- **Eleva Core**
  - Updated the `mount` method signature:
    - Now expects a DOM element container directly instead of a CSS selector string.
    - Altered the mounting process to always return a Promise (wrapping synchronous setups with `Promise.resolve`), ensuring consistent asynchronous handling.
    - Renamed internal parameters for clarity (e.g., using `styleFn` in the `_injectStyles` method).
- **Component Registration & Mounting Logic**
  - Revised internal logic to determine the component definition based on the type of the provided parameter (string vs. object).
- **Overall Code Quality**
  - Refined code style by consistently using ES6+ syntax.
  - Improved error messages and inline comments to facilitate better understanding and maintainability.

### 🔧 Fixed

- _N/A_ – No bug fixes in this release.
