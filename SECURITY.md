# Security Policy for Eleva

## Overview

The security and privacy of our users and contributors are of utmost importance to us at Eleva. This document outlines our security practices and provides guidelines for reporting potential vulnerabilities in the Eleva framework. Our goal is to work transparently and collaboratively with the security community to ensure that Eleva remains robust and secure.

## Supported Versions

I actively maintain Eleva. I encourage users to upgrade to the latest version to receive all security fixes and updates. For older versions, please refer to the documentation and release notes for any potential security-related advisories.

## Security Guidelines

- **Secure Coding Practices:**  
  I follow secure coding guidelines and regularly review the codebase for vulnerabilities.

- **Dependency Management:**  
  Eleva has zero external dependencies, which minimizes potential attack surfaces from third-party libraries.

- **Open Source & Peer Review:**  
  As an open-source project, Eleva benefits from community peer review. I encourage contributions and vigilance from the community to help identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in Eleva, please help us keep our community safe by reporting it privately and responsibly.

### Reporting Process

1. **Report Privately:**  
   Do not disclose any details publicly until the vulnerability has been addressed.  
   Email your report to: [tarek.m.raafat@gmail.com](mailto:tarek.m.raafat@gmail.com)

2. **Include Detailed Information:**  
   Your report should include:

   - A clear description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Any relevant logs, screenshots, or code samples.
   - The impact of the vulnerability (e.g., potential for data loss, unauthorized access, etc.).

3. **Responsible Disclosure:**  
   I request that you provide me with a reasonable period (typically 90 days) to investigate and address the vulnerability before any public disclosure.

4. **Collaboration:**  
   I may reach out to you for further details or clarification. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

## Our Commitment

- **Timely Review:**  
  I commit to reviewing all vulnerability reports promptly.

- **Transparency:**  
  Once a vulnerability is confirmed, I will issue a security advisory detailing the issue and the steps taken to resolve it.

- **Acknowledgement:**  
  I gratefully acknowledge the efforts of security researchers and community members who help improve the security of Eleva.
