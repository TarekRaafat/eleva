## **Benchmarking Methodology**

### **1. DOM Update Speed (Seconds)**

- **What it measures:** The time required to update the UI when the state changes.
- **Testing method:**
  - Each framework executed **100,000 UI updates**.
  - Measured execution time using Python’s `timeit` module.
  - Faster speeds indicate **better reactivity and efficiency**.

### **2. Bundle Size (KB)**

- **What it measures:** The compressed file size of the framework.
- **Testing method:**
  - Collected minified and gzipped sizes from official framework repositories.
  - Smaller sizes indicate **faster downloads and better performance**.

### **3. Initial Load Time (Milliseconds)**

- **What it measures:** The time taken to initialize the framework in a browser.
- **Testing method:**
  - Estimated based on **bundle size impact** and **framework overhead**.
  - Data obtained from **Google Lighthouse and WebPageTest**.

### **4. Peak Memory Usage (KB)**

- **What it measures:** The maximum RAM consumed by the framework when running updates.
- **Testing method:**
  - Used Python’s `tracemalloc` module to monitor **memory allocation**.
  - Conducted **100,000 updates per framework** and recorded peak memory usage.

### **5. Overall Performance Score**

- **What it measures:** A combined metric representing all performance aspects.
- **Testing method:**

  - Used the formula:

```math
\text{Performance Score} = \frac{\text{DOM Speed} + \text{Memory} + \text{Bundle Size} + \text{Load Time}}{4}
```

- Lower scores indicate **better overall efficiency**.

---

## **Findings & Key Insights**

- **Eleva outperforms other frameworks** in raw **speed, memory efficiency, and load time**.
- **React and Vue are well-optimized**, but their Virtual DOM and reactivity mechanisms introduce slight overhead.
- **Angular is the heaviest**, making it more suited for enterprise applications rather than lightweight apps.
- **Developers prioritizing performance and minimalism** should strongly consider Eleva.

---

## **Limitations & Considerations**

- These results are based on **controlled tests** and **may vary** based on **hardware, browser, and real-world application complexity**.
- Benchmarks do not **fully** account for **developer experience, ecosystem, or maintainability**.
- Real-world apps often involve **network requests, large datasets, and complex UI interactions**.

### **Recommendation**

Developers are encouraged to **conduct their own benchmarking tests** based on their specific use cases.

**Want to improve this benchmark?** If you have additional data or test results, please **update this document** and contribute your findings!

## **Conclusion**

Eleva is an **exceptionally lightweight and fast** framework that is best suited for **performance-critical applications**. While React, Vue, and Angular provide **additional abstractions**, they come at a cost in terms of **performance and memory usage**.

For projects where **speed, simplicity, and efficiency matter**, Eleva is a strong choice.

## **Disclaimer**

This benchmark was conducted under specific test conditions and may **not reflect** real-world performance in all scenarios. **Framework performance varies** depending on the complexity of applications, the browser environment, and system hardware.

I encourage developers to **run their own benchmarks** and provide feedback for continuous improvement of this document.
