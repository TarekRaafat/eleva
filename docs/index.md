## What is Eleva?

**Eleva** is a minimalist, lightweight (6KB), pure vanilla JavaScript frontend framework crafted for **exceptional Developer Experience (DX)**. When developers enjoy building, users enjoy using — Eleva makes it effortless to create beautiful, responsive, and performant User Interfaces (UI).

Unlike React, Vue, or Angular, Eleva:
- **Has zero dependencies** - No node_modules bloat
- **Requires no build step** - Works directly in browsers via CDN
- **Uses real DOM** - No virtual DOM overhead for simple apps
- **Provides signal-based reactivity** - Fine-grained updates like Solid.js
- **Includes TypeScript support** - Built-in type declarations
- **Is just JavaScript** - If it works in vanilla JS, it works in Eleva

Eleva is ideal for developers building performance-critical applications, data-intensive dashboards (10K+ rows), micro-frontends, or anyone seeking a simpler alternative to React, Vue, or Angular.

### Core Philosophy

> **💡 Vanilla JavaScript. Elevated.**

Eleva takes plain vanilla JavaScript to the next level. Signals for reactivity. Components for structure. Your JS knowledge stays front and center, not hidden behind abstractions. **If it works in vanilla JS, it works in Eleva.**

> _"The best UX comes from developers who love their tools."_ — Eleva's DX philosophy

> **Stable Release**: This is the official documentation for Eleva v1.0.1. The framework is production-ready with a stable API. We welcome your feedback and contributions to make Eleva even better.

---

## Quick Start

### 30-Second Setup

```javascript
// 1. Import
import Eleva from "eleva";

// 2. Create app
const app = new Eleva("MyApp");

// 3. Define component
app.component("Counter", {
  setup: ({ signal }) => ({ count: signal(0) }),
  template: (ctx) => `
    <button @click="() => count.value++">
      Count: ${ctx.count.value}
    </button>
  `
});

// 4. Mount
app.mount(document.getElementById("app"), "Counter");
```

### Installation

| Method | Command/Code |
|--------|--------------|
| **npm** | `npm install eleva` |
| **CDN (jsDelivr)** | `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/eleva"></script>` |
| **CDN (unpkg)** | `<script src="https://unpkg.com/eleva"></script>` |
| **ESM Import** | `import Eleva from "eleva"` |
| **Plugin Import** | `import { Router, Store } from "eleva/plugins"` |

### API Cheatsheet

| Method | Description | Returns |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `new Eleva(name)` | Create app instance | `Eleva` |
| `app.component(name, def)` | Register component | `Eleva` |
| `app.mount(el, name, props?)` | Mount to DOM | `Promise<MountResult>` |
| `app.use(plugin, options?)` | Install plugin | `Eleva` or plugin result |
| `signal(value)` | Create reactive state | `Signal<T>` |
| `emitter.on(event, fn)` | Subscribe to event | `() => void` (unsubscribe) |
| `emitter.emit(event, data)` | Emit event | `void` |

### Template Syntax

> **Quick Rule:** `${}` needs `ctx.` — `@events` and `:props` don't.

| Syntax | Purpose | `ctx.`? | Example |
|--------|---------|:-------:|---------|
| `${expr}` | JavaScript value interpolation | Yes | `${ctx.user.name}` |
| `@event` | Event binding | No | `@click="handleClick"` |
| `:prop` | Pass prop to child | No | `:user="userData.value"` |

## Framework Comparison

How does Eleva compare to popular JavaScript frameworks?

| Feature | Eleva 1.0 | React 19 | Vue 3.5 | Svelte 5 | Angular 19 |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|----------|------------|
| **Bundle Size** | ~6KB | ~44KB | ~45KB | ~3KB* | ~90KB |
| **Dependencies** | 0 | 3+ | 0 | 0 | 10+ |
| **Virtual DOM** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| **Reactivity** | Signals | useState/Hooks | Refs/Reactive | Compiler | Zone.js |
| **TypeScript** | Built-in | Optional | Optional | Built-in | Built-in |
| **Build Required** | No | Yes | Optional | Yes | Yes |
| **Learning Curve** | Low | Medium | Medium | Low | High |
| **Component Model** | Object-based | JSX/Functional | SFC/Options | SFC | Decorators |

_*Svelte compiles away, so runtime is minimal but build step is required._

### When to Use Eleva

**Choose Eleva when you need:**
- High performance without complexity (~6KB, 240fps capable, handles 10K+ rows)
- Zero build tooling—works directly in browsers via CDN
- Micro-frontends, embedded widgets, or progressive enhancement
- Data-intensive UIs where bundle size and render speed matter
- A simpler, lightweight alternative to React or Vue

**Consider other frameworks when you need:**
- Extensive ecosystem with mature tooling (React, Vue)
- Large team with established patterns (Angular)
- Built-in SSR/SSG frameworks (Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit)
- Compiler-based optimization (Svelte)

---

## Developer Experience (DX)

Eleva is built on a simple principle: **great DX leads to great UX**. When developers have intuitive tools, they build better interfaces.

### Why Eleva's DX Stands Out

| DX Feature | How It Helps You Build Better UX |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| **Zero Config** | Start building immediately — no webpack, no bundlers, no setup |
| **Intuitive API** | Learn in minutes, master in hours — more time for polishing UI |
| **Pure JavaScript** | No JSX, no compilation — what you write is what runs |
| **Instant Feedback** | Signal-based reactivity shows changes immediately |
| **TypeScript Built-in** | Full autocomplete and type safety out of the box |
| **Tiny Bundle** | ~2.3KB gzipped means instant page loads for your users |
| **No Hidden Magic** | Debug easily with transparent, predictable behavior |

### DX-First Design Principles

- **Predictable** — No surprises. The framework behaves exactly as documented.
- **Debuggable** — Clear error messages and easy-to-trace execution flow.
- **Self-Documenting** — API names that make sense without checking docs.
- **Fast Iteration** — Change code, see results instantly. No build delays.
- **Familiar Patterns** — If you know JavaScript, you know Eleva.

## Performance

Eleva is built for high-performance applications. With an average render time of **0.011ms**, Eleva can theoretically achieve **90,000+ fps** for simple updates:

| FPS Target | Frame Budget | Eleva Capability | Status |
|------------|--------------|------------------|:------:|
| **60 fps** | 16.67ms | ~1,500 renders possible | Supported |
| **120 fps** | 8.33ms | ~750 renders possible | Supported |
| **240 fps** | 4.17ms | ~380 renders possible | Supported |

**Performance Highlights:**
- **240fps+ capable** - Framework never limits frame rate
- **Smallest bundle size** (~2.3 KB vs 35-90 KB)
- **Competitive initial render** (~25ms for 1K rows)
- **Zero dependencies** and minimal runtime overhead
- **Automatic render batching** - Multiple signal changes = 1 render

---

## Browser Support

Eleva targets **modern evergreen browsers** and requires no polyfills for supported environments.

| Browser | Minimum Version |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Chrome** | 71+ |
| **Firefox** | 69+ |
| **Safari** | 12.1+ |
| **Edge** | 79+ (Chromium) |

> **Coverage:** The supported browsers cover approximately **96%+ of global web traffic**.
