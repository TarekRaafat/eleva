/**
 * @fileoverview Tests for the Signal module of the Eleva framework
 *
 * These tests verify the reactivity system implemented through the Signal class, including:
 * - Value initialization and retrieval
 * - Change detection and notification
 * - Watcher registration and triggering
 * - Watcher unsubscription functionality
 * - Edge case handling
 *
 * The Signal module provides the reactive state management system for the Eleva framework,
 * allowing components to track and respond to state changes efficiently. It forms the
 * foundation of Eleva's reactivity model, enabling automatic UI updates when component
 * state changes.
