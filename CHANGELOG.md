## v1.0.0-rc.3 (01-08-2025)

### 📝 Release Notes

#### 🔧 Fixed

- **Plugin Installation Order Bug**
  - Fixed a critical bug in the core `Eleva.js` where plugin installation order could lead to inconsistent plugin state.
  - The `use()` method now registers the plugin in the internal registry before calling `plugin.install()`, ensuring proper plugin state management.
  - This prevents issues where failed plugin installations would leave the framework in an inconsistent state and improves error handling for plugin developers.

### 💻 Developer Notes
- This change is fully backward compatible and does not affect the public API or existing plugin functionality.
- Plugin installation is now more robust and reliable, improving the overall stability of the plugin system.
- No action is required for existing plugins, but the framework now handles plugin installation errors more gracefully.

#### 🎁 Benefits
- **For Framework Developers:**
  - More reliable plugin state management
  - Better error handling during plugin installation
  - Improved debugging capabilities for plugin-related issues
  - Consistent plugin registry state regardless of installation success
- **For Plugin Developers:**
  - More predictable plugin installation behavior
  - Better error handling and debugging support
  - Improved reliability when developing complex plugins

#### 🛠️ Technical Details
- The `use()` method now follows the pattern: register plugin → install plugin → return instance
- This ensures that if `plugin.install()` throws an error, the plugin is already registered and can be properly tracked
- The change maintains the same public API while improving internal reliability

---

## v1.0.0-rc.2 (06-07-2025)

### 📝 Release Notes

#### 🔧 Fixed

- **Scoped Style Attribute Bug** ([#1](https://github.com/TarekRaafat/eleva/issues/1))
  - Fixed a critical bug in the core `Eleva.js` where mounting a component using a definition object (instead of a string name) caused the injected `<style>` element to have an invalid `data-e-style="[object Object]"` attribute.
  - The framework now always generates a unique, valid identifier for each component's style element, ensuring proper style scoping and valid HTML attributes regardless of how the component is mounted.
  - This resolves issues with style deduplication, DOM inspection, and future compatibility with stricter style management logic.

### 💻 Developer Notes
- This change is fully backward compatible and does not affect the public API or plugin system.
- Styles are now reliably scoped and deduplicated, improving both developer experience and future extensibility.
- No action is required for existing code, but direct mounting of component objects is now fully supported and safe.

#### 🎁 Benefits
- **For Framework Developers:**
  - Valid and predictable style element attributes for all component types
  - Improved maintainability and future-proofing of the style injection system
  - No more invalid HTML attributes in the DOM
- **For Plugin Developers:**
  - Reliable style scoping and deduplication for advanced plugin use cases
  - Consistent behavior regardless of component registration method

#### 🛠️ Technical Details
- The `mount` method now assigns a unique component ID (`cN`) for every mounted component, which is used as the `data-e-style` attribute for injected styles.
- This approach guarantees that style elements are always correctly identified and scoped, even for anonymous or directly-passed component objects.
- No more reliance on stringifying the component definition or using potentially invalid attribute values.

- All core features are finalized; only critical bug fixes and documentation updates are expected before the final `1.0.0` release.

### 📝 Release Notes

#### 🎛️ Changed

- **Component Props Extraction Refactor**
  - Refactored the `_extractProps` method in `Eleva.js` core for improved attribute extraction and cleanup:
    - Now safely checks for the presence of `element.attributes` before processing
    - Uses a reverse loop over attributes for safer removal during iteration.
    - Removes extracted attributes from the element after copying their values
    - Improves robustness and prevents potential errors with non-standard elements

### 💻 Developer Notes

  - Revised internal logic to determine the component definition based on the type of the provided parameter (string vs. object).
- **Overall Code Quality**
  - Refined code style by consistently using ES6+ syntax.
  - Improved error messages and inline comments to facilitate better understanding and maintainability.
