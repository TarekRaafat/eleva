# Known Limitations

This document outlines the current limitations and potential issues in Eleva.js v1.2.3-alpha. I'm actively working on addressing these limitations and welcome community feedback to help prioritize improvements.

## Core Framework Limitations

These limitations are considered core framework concerns that I plan to address directly in the framework:

### Component System

#### Complex Component Hierarchies
- Deeply nested component structures (5+ levels) may experience performance degradation
- Circular component dependencies are not properly handled
- Component inheritance patterns are not supported

**Rationale:** These are fundamental architectural concerns that affect the core component system's reliability and performance.

### Performance

#### DOM Operations
- Large DOM updates (1000+ nodes) may cause temporary UI freezes
- Frequent attribute updates on many elements can impact performance
- Complex CSS selectors in scoped styles may affect rendering performance

**Rationale:** These are core performance issues that directly impact the framework's rendering engine.

#### Memory Management
- Memory usage may grow with long-running applications
- No automatic garbage collection for unused components
- Event listeners need manual cleanup in some edge cases

**Rationale:** These are fundamental resource management issues that affect the framework's stability.

## Plugin-Recommended Features

These features are intentionally not included in the core framework to maintain Eleva's minimalist design philosophy. They are recommended to be implemented as plugins:

### State Management
- No built-in state persistence
- Complex state synchronization between components requires manual implementation
- No automatic state cleanup on component unmount

**Rationale:** State management patterns vary significantly between applications. Keeping it as a plugin allows developers to choose their preferred approach (e.g., Redux, MobX, or custom solutions).

### Development Tools
- Limited built-in debugging tools
- No visual component inspector
- Error messages could be more descriptive

**Rationale:** Development tools are environment-specific and should be optional. This keeps the core framework lean and allows for specialized debugging solutions.

### Testing
- No official testing utilities
- Component testing requires manual setup
- No built-in performance profiling tools

**Rationale:** Testing approaches vary by team and project. Keeping testing as a plugin ecosystem allows for specialized testing solutions without bloating the core.

### Browser Support
- Requires modern browser features (ES2015+)
- Some features may not work in older browsers
- No polyfills included for legacy support
- Mobile browser optimizations needed
- Touch event handling needs improvement

**Rationale:** Browser compatibility and polyfills should be optional based on project requirements. This allows for targeted support without affecting all users.

### Plugin System Enhancements
- No built-in plugin dependency management
- Limited plugin lifecycle hooks
- No plugin hot-reloading support
- Plugin conflicts are not automatically resolved

**Rationale:** These are meta-features that should be handled by a dedicated plugin management system, keeping the core framework focused on essential functionality.

### Documentation Tools
- Some advanced features lack detailed examples
- API documentation needs more real-world use cases
- Migration guides for future versions are pending
- Limited complex application examples
- No enterprise-level implementation patterns

**Rationale:** Documentation and examples are better maintained as separate tools and community resources, allowing for more specialized and up-to-date documentation.

## Future Improvements

I'm actively working on addressing these limitations. Here's our prioritized roadmap:

### Core Framework Improvements
1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Optimize DOM diffing algorithm
   - Improve memory management
   - Enhance component lifecycle handling

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Improve error messages
   - Enhance core debugging capabilities
   - Streamline component registration

### Plugin Ecosystem Development
1. **Official Plugin Examples**
   - Router plugin
   - State management plugin template
   - Testing utilities plugin
   - Development tools plugin
   - Browser compatibility plugin

2. **Plugin Guidelines**
   - Best practices for plugin development
   - Plugin architecture documentation
   - Plugin compatibility guidelines

3. **Plugin System Architecture**
   - Lightweight plugin registration system
   - Minimal plugin API surface
   - Pure vanilla JavaScript plugin interface
   - Plugin lifecycle hooks optimization
   - Plugin isolation and sandboxing

4. **Plugin Discovery & Distribution**
   - Official plugin registry
   - Plugin versioning guidelines
   - Plugin compatibility matrix
   - Plugin size and performance guidelines
   - Plugin documentation standards

5. **Plugin Development Experience**
   - Plugin development CLI tools
   - Plugin testing utilities
   - Plugin debugging helpers

**Rationale:** These improvements focus on:
- Maintaining minimalism by keeping the plugin system lightweight and focused
- Supporting pure vanilla JavaScript through simple, native APIs
- Enhancing extensibility with robust plugin architecture
- Promoting developer experience with comprehensive tools
- Ensuring performance and security through proper plugin management
- Building a sustainable plugin ecosystem
